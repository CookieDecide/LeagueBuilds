# LeagueBuilds

LeagueBuild uses a centralized server to get recent builds of Master, Grandmaster and Challenger League of Legends Players and store them in a local database. Those builds, which include runes, summoner spells and most bought items, can be accessed per a client. During championselect the client will inject the most popular build for the champion the player currently hovers using the LCU API.

# ToDo:
- add suport for ARAM matches
